        <div>
          <p>This site is built with <strong>Next.js</strong>, a React framework that’s great for server-side rendering, which boosts load times by generating content at build time and improves SEO. Next.js also provides automatic image resizing, which is really useful for handling different screen sizes.</p>
          <p>I’m using the <code>output: standalone</code> option in my build process, which bundles everything into a single package, including a <code>server.js</code> file that handles image resizing and serves all assets. I package all of this into a Docker image and run it on my Kubernetes cluster.</p>
          <p>Initially, I hosted the site on Vercel, but I wanted more control, so I moved everything to my own <strong>K3s-based Kubernetes cluster</strong>. (If you’re curious about how I set up the cluster, I wrote a blog post about it <a href="/blog/how-i-setup-my-k3s-kubernetes-cluster">here</a>.)</p>

                  {index < steps.length - 1 && (

          <h2 className="text-xl">Optimizing the Docker Image</h2>
          <p>A major concern when building a Docker image is size. If you go with a standard non-alpine based Node.js base image and just install all dependencies, you’ll end up with an image that’s over <strong>1.6GB</strong>. That’s way too big for production.</p>
          <p>Thankfully, Next.js offers a template to slim down the image. I use the <strong><code>node:20-alpine</code></strong> image, which is significantly smaller (116MB) compared to the default Debian image (around 1.1GB). Then, I follow a <strong>multi-stage build</strong> process:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Build the Next.js project in the first stage.</li>
            <li>Copy only the necessary production files into the final image.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This approach results in a much smaller image—about <strong>214MB</strong>, which is reasonable for production.</p>

            <Image src="/blog/my-own-vercel-how-i-deploy-this-website/docker-image-size.png" alt="Docker Image Size" width={1000} height={1000} className="w-full h-auto object-contain rounded-lg" />
          </div>
          <p>Here’s the <strong>Dockerfile</strong> I use:</p>
          <EmbedGist gistId="l4r-s/75cd730a6064fbbf03f3edec69cb10f1" file="Dockerfile" />

          <h2 className="text-xl">How I Deploy It</h2>
          <p>For deployments, I use a combination of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>GitHub Actions</strong>: This handles the automation, triggering builds and deployments whenever there’s a commit or PR.</li>
            <li><strong>Helm & Helmfile</strong>: These manage the Kubernetes deployments. Helmfile lets me declaratively define everything I need for the deployment, so I can reuse Helm charts easily. A post about my personal helm chart repository is coming next!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Here’s a simplified version of the process:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The Next.js build is created in a builder stage.</li>
            <li>The production build is copied into the final Docker image.</li>
            <li>The pipeline pushes the image to my private Docker registry, tagged with the commit SHA.</li>
            <li>The Helmfile applies the release to my cluster, using the image tag from the commit.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This is the helmfile I use:</p>
          <EmbedGist gistId="l4r-s/75cd730a6064fbbf03f3edec69cb10f1" file="helmfile.yaml" />

          <h2 className="text-xl">Making it More Like Vercel</h2>
          <p>One of the things I liked about Vercel was the automatic preview deployments for pull requests (PRs). When you open a PR on Github, Vercel automatically deploys the changes and gives you a preview link. I wanted to bring that feature to my setup too!</p>
          <p>So, I set up <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> to do the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>When a new PR is opened, GitHub Actions builds the Docker image as described above.</li>
            <li>The image is pushed to my private registry.</li>
            <li>The site is deployed with a unique release name and URL based on the PR number with the help of environment variables in the helmfile.</li>
            <li>Github Actions adds a comment to the PR with the deployment URL.
              <div className="w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg mb-6">
                <Image src="/blog/my-own-vercel-how-i-deploy-this-website/pr-comment.png" alt="Github PR Comment" width={1000} height={1000} className="w-full h-auto object-contain rounded-lg" />
              </div>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Here’s how it looks in the <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> workflow:</p>
          <EmbedGist gistId="l4r-s/75cd730a6064fbbf03f3edec69cb10f1" file="build-dev.yml" />
          <p>This setup mimics the PR-based preview feature of Vercel, but with full control over my infrastructure. When the PR is merged or closed, the deployment is cleaned up automatically.</p>
        </div>
